# Welcome to Our Daily Technical Blog Series!

Hello developers! 👋

Welcome to the **Bhagat Singh Private Limited India** daily technical blog series. We're excited to start this journey with you, sharing knowledge, insights, and practical tutorials that will help you grow as a developer.

Today marks **Day 01** of our commitment to daily technical content. We'll be covering everything from beginner-friendly tutorials to advanced architectural patterns, all focused on helping Indian developers excel in the global tech ecosystem.

## Why Next.js?

For our inaugural post, let's talk about **Next.js** - one of the most powerful React frameworks that's revolutionizing how we build web applications.

### What Makes Next.js Special?

Next.js isn't just another React framework. It's a comprehensive solution that addresses many common challenges in modern web development:

#### 1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG)**
```javascript
// This function runs at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  return {
    props: {
      data: await data.json(),
    },
    // Regenerate the page at most once per hour
    revalidate: 3600,
  };
}
```

#### 2. **File-Based Routing**
No more complex routing configurations! Create a file, get a route:
```
pages/
  index.js          → /
  about.js          → /about
  blog/
    index.js        → /blog
    [slug].js       → /blog/:slug
```

#### 3. **API Routes**
Build your backend and frontend in the same project:
```javascript
// pages/api/users.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    res.status(200).json({ users: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'] });
  }
}
```

### Real-World Benefits

Here's why companies like **Netflix**, **Twitch**, and **Hulu** choose Next.js:

- **Performance**: Automatic code splitting and optimization
- **SEO**: Server-side rendering for better search engine visibility
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and excellent tooling
- **Deployment**: Seamless deployment with Vercel (though we use GitHub Pages!)

## Getting Started: Your First Next.js App

Let's build a simple blog (like this one!) step by step:

### Step 1: Create Your Project
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind --app
cd my-blog
```

### Step 2: Create Your First Page
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">
        Welcome to My Blog
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600">
        Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Step 3: Add a Blog Post
```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation';

interface BlogPostProps {
  params: { slug: string };
}

export default function BlogPost({ params }: BlogPostProps) {
  // In a real app, you'd fetch this data
  const post = getBlogPost(params.slug);

  if (!post) {
    notFound();
  }

  return (
    <article className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">{post.title}</h1>
      <div className="prose prose-lg">
        {post.content}
      </div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices We Follow

At **Bhagat Singh Private Limited India**, we follow these Next.js best practices:

### 1. **Project Structure**
```
src/
  app/
    layout.tsx      # Root layout
    page.tsx        # Home page
    blog/
      page.tsx      # Blog listing
      [slug]/
        page.tsx    # Individual blog posts
  components/       # Reusable components
  lib/             # Utility functions
  content/         # Blog posts (MDX files)
```

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Use `next/image` for optimized images
- Implement dynamic imports for code splitting
- Leverage static generation when possible
- Optimize fonts with `next/font`

### 3. **SEO Best Practices**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog',
  description: 'A blog about web development',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'My Blog',
    description: 'A blog about web development',
    images: ['/og-image.jpg'],
  },
};
```
